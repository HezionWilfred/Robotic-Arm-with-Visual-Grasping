[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:29 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgenerate_parameter_library.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "generate_parameter_library", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "generate_parameter_library" with any of the following names:

    generate_parameter_libraryConfig.cmake
    generate_parameter_library-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "generate_parameter_library" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "generate_parameter_library_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "generate_parameter_library"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
